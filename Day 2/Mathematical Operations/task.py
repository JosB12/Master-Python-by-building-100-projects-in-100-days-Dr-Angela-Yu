#Code Challege
# The body mass index (BMI) is a measure used in medicine to see if someone is underweight or overweight. This is the formula used to calculate it:
# bmi is equal to the person's weight divided by the person's height squared.

height = 1.65
weight = 84

# Write your code here.
# Calculate the bmi using weight and height.
bmi = (weight) / height**2

print(bmi)
